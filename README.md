# Problem Statement
Stock market investments is a fundamental stimulus for most of the market researchers in this area, as well as generating great profits. Machine learning helps in fundamental analysis, it's mostly based on analysing text and sentiments. Technical analysis is simply a pure number game where a bunch of numeric past information is mapped to a number, expected to be the future price.

# Model

The model I built is a simple RNN model, using bidirectional LSTM
