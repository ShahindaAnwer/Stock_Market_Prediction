Time series analysis is a way of analyzing sequences of data points collected over a time interval. Data points are recorded at consistent intervals over a period of time instead of them being randomly recorded. Time series data has an advantage of having its variables show its change over time, as well as being used for predicting future data based on historical data.

Time series analysis is important as it helps organizations understand trends and patterns over time, in addition to thier causes; where time series forecasting could be used, which shows likely changes in the data.

Time series prediction data are basically non-stationary data, this includes stock market analysis, weather changes, Heart rate monitoring and many more.
